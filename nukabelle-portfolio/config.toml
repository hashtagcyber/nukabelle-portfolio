  "Someone asked me once, “What got you into drawing?” and immediately I said Bob Ross. You remember that show on PBS, right? I used to love watching him paint beautiful landscapes and as I grew up, I knew I wanted to do the same thing (Minus the big hair. Sorry, Bob.).",
  "My name is Shell, but you can call me NukaBelle, and I love creating landscapes, characters, cartoons, animals and more. Basically, anything that catches my eye and sparks my imagination — whether from books, movies or video games — it’s all fair game to me."
