Someone asked me once, “What got you into drawing?” and immediately I said **Bob Ross**. You remember that show on PBS, right? I used to love watching him paint beautiful landscapes and as I grew up, I knew I wanted to do the same thing (Minus the big hair. Sorry, Bob.).

My name is Shell, but you can call me **NukaBelle**, and I love creating landscapes, characters, cartoons, animals and more. Basically, anything that catches my eye and sparks my imagination — whether from books, movies or video games — it’s all fair game to me.

I really love playing with vivid colors and lighting effects to bring things to life the way I see them in my mind. And while I love creating in any medium, digital art lets me do this the best. It doesn’t hurt that you can bring a digital sketch pad with you a whole lot easier than a painting easel.

So if you’re a little bit like me — a little bit nerdy, a little bit quirky but a whole lot of fun — then check out my wares. If you don’t see what you’re looking for, send me a message. I’d love to make something unique just for you! After all, I am happiest when I can do something for someone else and make other people happy.
